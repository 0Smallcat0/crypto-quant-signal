# Autonomous research loop — iteration log (append-only)

## 2026-07-21 — iteration 0 (sprint session, human-supervised)

- Universe expanded 2 → 13 qualified symbols; quality gate 13/13 PASS
  (`docs/research/UNIVERSE_EXPANSION.md`, commit 71063e7).
- Experiment 3 pre-registered and FROZEN: cross-sectional momentum,
  16 configs (commit 972c44d).
- Daily loop scheduled: task `CryptoResearchLoop`, 21:37 local,
  runs `scripts/run_research_loop.ps1`.
- **Next step (Q1): implement the `cross_sectional_momentum` engine path +
  tests. Nothing has run yet; registry N is still 21.**

## 2026-07-21 — iteration 1 (Q1, autonomous)

- Research log appended (4 dated lines): Springer FMPM 2025 XS-momentum
  fragility warning, Cambridge JFQA 2024 trend-factor result parked for a
  future family, Trakx practitioner cost-drag confirmation, ACFR AUT
  homogeneous-universe read-out — all mapped to the pre-registered grid
  arms in `docs/research/RESEARCH_LOG.md`.
- `BacktestParameters` extended with `cs_top_k`, `cs_lookback_days`,
  `cs_rebalance_cadence`, `cs_absolute_filter`, `cs_min_pool_size`
  (`src/backtest/types.py`). Strategy whitelist now allows
  `"cross_sectional_momentum"`; the vol overlay is refused for it because
  cross-sectional weights are already normalized.
- Engine dispatch added at the top of `run_backtest` in
  `src/backtest/engine.py`; ladder path untouched. New
  `_run_cross_sectional_backtest` implements the mechanical spec: union of
  candle dates, per-decision lookback ranking, top-K equal-weight snap,
  absolute-filter arm, cadence-driven weekly/monthly rebalance, next-bar-open
  execution reusing `_execute_ladder_change` for order plumbing.
- 12 new tests in `tests/backtest/test_cross_sectional_backtest.py` cover
  validation errors, cadence key semantics, top-K selection, absolute filter,
  min-pool-size gate, monthly cadence firing, hold-day fill absence, cost
  assumptions surfacing, and ladder-strategy non-regression.
- Verification bare (rule 7): `ruff check` PASS; `ruff format --check` PASS;
  `mypy --strict src/` PASS (57 files, 0 issues after installing missing
  `websockets` and `types-PyYAML` env deps that pre-dated this iteration);
  `lint-imports` 13/13 KEPT; `pytest -m "not network"` 349 passed in 109.57s.
- Registry N unchanged at 21. Family runs are Q2 work, deferred to a future
  iteration per the multi-session split allowed by the contract.
- **Next step (Q2): run the 16-config experiment-3 family through
  `run_registered_backtest`, register 16 new trials (N: 21 → 37), commit
  registry rows and per-trial return series.**

## 2026-07-21 — iteration 2 (Q2+Q3, operator-triggered "直接接著跑")

- Alignment bug caught BEFORE running: cs decision times started at the
  lookback floor, so 90d/180d arms would have produced misaligned return
  series and the gate report would abort. Fixed with
  `cs_decision_start` (engine floor + validation + 2 tests), pinning all
  family series to the registry window (2676 returns,
  2018-03-05 → 2025-07-01). Commit 6163655.
- Family ran clean (trials 22-37). Winner trial 29 (K=2/180d/monthly/
  filter-on): Sharpe 1.4109, **DSR 0.962102 — first ≥ 0.95 in project
  history** — but MDD 75.08% fails criterion 2 by 23.15pp.
  **Family = registered negative.** Full table + verdict in
  `docs/research/GOALP_EXPERIMENT3_RESULT.md`.
- Stop condition NOT met: candidates-PBO 0.5834 > 0.05 (and the cs family
  folds to one candidates column — defect documented in the result file;
  runner serialization forward-fixed).
- **Next step (Q4, NEXT session per drift guard): pre-register the
  risk-managed combination family (cs momentum signal × drawdown/vol
  overlay) targeting MDD without killing the deflation-surviving Sharpe.
  Also compute trial 29 × trial 4 return correlation (queued read-out).**
